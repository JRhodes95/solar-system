- Classes are prototypes for objects - ie Pet = class, dog = instance of class i.e. object
  - Functions in a class are methods
- Code style - PEP8 is a code style guide for python including things like docstrings and indentation
- Conditionals and loops
  - Conditionals choose between options (if, else)
  - Loops iterate( perform the same thing until we tell them to stop)
- Saving to files
  - Use numpy.savetxt if we can
- Code structure
- Testing
- Making the code easier to use
  - use functions to prevent repetition of code (extract logic AND test it)
  - default parameters can be used where they make sense
